# Bingo - The game

Notes: 

- The server will be executiong on port **5001** (i.e `localhost://5001`) unless other server location is provided(for ex: Heroku or back4app etc.)
- `socket.io` dependency (in package.json ) is `1.7.1` (higher versions not supported the socket communication for some reason)

Steps to run the project: 
- `npm install` (to install all dependencies from the `package.json` file)
- `npm start` to run the server. (npm start is running the `server.js` (verify that in the `package.json` file))
